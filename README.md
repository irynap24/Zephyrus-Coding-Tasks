Task 1: String Reverse

1. .split('') splits the string into an array of characters.
2. .reverse('') reverse the array.
3. .join('') array is joined back into a string

Task 2: FizzBuzz

1. for loop: Loops through numbers 1 to 100 using the for loop (i is incremented by 1).
2. if condition: The first if checks if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 using the modulus operator (%). If true, it prints "FizzBuzz".
3. else if for 3: The next condition checks if the number is only divisible by 3 and prints "Fizz".
4. else if for 5: The subsequent condition checks if the number is only divisible by 5 and prints "Buzz".
5. else: If none of the above conditions are true, the number itself is printed.

Task 3: Even or Odd

1. Using the modulo operator (%) checks if the remainder when dividing num by 2 is 0.
2. If the remainder is 0 , return "Even", otherwise return "Odd"
